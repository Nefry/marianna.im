I'm a software performance engineer and love everything about performance in IT and Arts. 
One of my creative outlets is theatre: I enjoy watching performances and have acted onstage. I also enjoy travelling and each trip I go on I add a new postcard to my collection. I've already visited more than 15 countries on 2 continents - still lot's to see!
